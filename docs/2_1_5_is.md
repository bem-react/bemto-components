### Redefining the rendered root tag

Sometimes you could need to have a certain tag for your bemto component, or render it by using some other component as a foundation. For doing this, there is a special prop available: `__is`, when you pass it for your bemto component, it would use it instead of guessing and auto-detecting the tag:

    const Foo = bemto('span.foo');
    const Bar = bemto('span.bar', { props: { href: '#x' } });

    <p>
      <Foo>I'm a span</Foo>
      <Foo __is='strong'>I'm a strong</Foo>
      <Foo __is={Bar}>I'm a link</Foo>
    </p>

You can see that we can pass both tag name, or any other component, and that component would be rendered with the props you'll pass to your bemto component.

Note that `__is` would always render the tag passed tag, even if you'd pass attributes that would normally make bemto-component to render a contextual tag:

    const Foo = bemto('span.foo');

    <p>
      <Foo __is='strong' href='#x'>I'm a strong even while I have `href`</Foo>
    </p>
