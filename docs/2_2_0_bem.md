## BEM: Blocks, Elements, Modifiers 🍱 🍙 🍣

If we'd look at the definition of [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/):

> BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a component-based approach to web development. The idea behind it is to divide the user interface into independent blocks.

We'll see that that's basically the description of the modern component-based development. And a lot of people say that all the new solutions made BEM obsolete. But what had really happen is that most of the modern components solutions solved just the “B” part: the “Blocks”. Let's look again at the [definition of the “Block”](https://en.bem.info/methodology/key-concepts/#block):

> Block: a logically and functionally independent page component, the equivalent of a component in Web Components. A block encapsulates behavior (JavaScript), templates, styles (CSS), and other implementation technologies. Blocks being independent allows for their re-use, as well as facilitating the project development and support process.

Yep, that's our components, and our basic `bemto()` is just a block. But BEM is a lot more: it has, at least, “Elements” and “Modifiers”. And those are very powerful concepts, which could be re-introduced into modern components. Bemto-components does just that.
